- 👋 Hi, I’m @kellywin (but you can just call me Kelly!) 
- 👀 I’m interested in learning about all there is to know about the Cloud (ultimate career goal: get into cloud security) ☁️  
- 🌱 I completed the Junior Cloud Practitioner program at Generation USA and currently hold the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certification. Currently, I am a Cybersecurity student at Springboard and studying for the CompTIA Security+ certification.  
- 👩🏻‍💻 When I'm not learning or practicing how to code, you can catch me watching anime, at the gym, learning about personal finance, and recently home improvement DIYs!
- 🐶 If I'm ever fortunate enough, I would love to run a doggie sanctuary (I currently have 3 hyperactive and cuddly German Shepherds).
- 📫 How to reach me: either by email or on Linkedin!
